# About this project

Project presented for #Adathon (@Ada-IT's Hackathon) event. This is an MVP of a communication tool for the Fundaci√≥n Niwok (NGO) and the wichi women's community. 

For this project, our team had less than 18 hours to code a solution that allows the women of the Wichi community (an indigenous ethnic group from the Central Chaco and the Southern Chaco, Argentina) to be informed about the artisan products they must make to deliver to the foundation for it to distribute them in stores around the world.
